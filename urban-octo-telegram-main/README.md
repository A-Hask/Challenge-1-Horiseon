# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge, I did the following:
1. I added header, body, and footer tags where appropriate
2. I added alt attributes to all images
3. I consolidated lines of CSS where appropriate
4. I made div tags more specific to describe what each section is
5. I added comments to the sections of code in both HTML and CSS to further describe what each section is/does
6. I adjusted the file/folder structure
